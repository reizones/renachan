        <p><strong>Genshin Impact Eula Vs Zhongli</strong>. If you like tall and cool girls go for Eula. Wielding her sword Eula consumes all the stacks of Grimheart and lashes forward dealing AoE Cryo DMG to opponents in front of her. Zhongli increases the PHYS shred but between Icetide Vortex and Superconduct its not as impactful as the interrupt resistance and safety from Jade Shield. Eula could open up some flexibility in using different comps from my normal lineups which was why I was initially excited for her.</p>

<p>Should you not have Zhongli not be new have a plethora of units unbuilt and need one that shall give your team an edge Zhongli is that unit. Zhonglis attack and defense both rise with respect to his HP. Increases Eulas resistance to interruption and DEF. For this reason Zhongli can provide a higher DPS potential for the whole team even if Xinyans shield effect is better for Eula. It is natural that one would desire the newest toy unit but one must consider their personal situations. If you want to play with a tall and cool guy go for Zhongli.</p>

<p>Zhonglis attack and defense both rise with respect to his HP. But the real difference lies within their elemental burst. What Patch 15 Banner is best value. Zhongli is definitely the coolest male character but I still prefer to run with a waifu squad.
