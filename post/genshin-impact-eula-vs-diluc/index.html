        <p><strong>Genshin Impact Eula Vs Diluc</strong>. The game features a massive gorgeous map an elaborate elemental combat system engaging storyline characters co-op game mode soothing soundtrack. Overall Eula looks to be a fun addition to a roster though her reliance on Physical DMG as part of her kit would mean less of those juicy Elemental Reaction numbers youd see on Diluc or Hutao. This effect can stack up to 3 times and can only occur once every 15s. While Hu Tao might need a healer more so than Diluc she makes up for.</p>
