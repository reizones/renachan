        <p><strong>Genshin Impact Diluc Favonius Greatsword</strong>. It is usually only issued after the approval of both the Grand Master and the Church. I swap out my instructor 120 elemental mastery boost for 8 secs swap out my other instructor 120. This heavy greatsword is not only an honor bestowed upon a Knight of Favonius but also the fruit of hard work and skills of the guardians of Mondstadt. It channels elemental power easily and is highly destructive.</p>
